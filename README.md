# Red-Teaming-Bypass-Av
Mainly recorded in the daily work of the red team, how I bypassed the AV, sorted out the Internet and some of my means,  all of which were successfully repetition learned by me.

Finally, I wish you can learn new ideas here, mainly ideas. you can use these methods to continuously variation and generate your own FUD trojan. After all, Bypass anti-virus software is a long-term work. Once the methods are published, then excellent virus analysis engineers will stare at your trojan demo program for continuous analysis, and then add file features to their Database, so as to carry out the killing.

Good lucky!
